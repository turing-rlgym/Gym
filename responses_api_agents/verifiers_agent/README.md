# Description

This agent enables running Prime Intellect [verifiers](https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/verifiers) and [Environments Hub](https://app.primeintellect.ai/dashboard/environments?ex_sort=by_sections) in NeMo Gym and its training framework integrations. 

No resources server is needed, as state, verification, tool logic, and typical roles of the resources server is handled already by verifiers environments.

## Install Gym

```
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Gym
cd Gym
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv sync
```

## Test acereason-math example 

First set `env.yaml` for a local model:
```
policy_base_url: "http://localhost:8000/v1"
policy_api_key: "dummy"
policy_model_name: "Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507"
```

Next, serve the model. 

Make sure to serve the model with longer context length than the generation length in your agent config (e.g. acereason-math.yaml)
<!-- we could probably be smarter about that -->

```
uv pip install vllm 
vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 --max-model-len 32768 --reasoning-parser qwen3 --enable-auto-tool-choice --tool-call-parser hermes
```


Now launch NeMo Gym servers:
```
uv sync # uv pip install vllm can mess with the venv, so resync

ng_run "+config_paths=[responses_api_agents/verifiers_agent/configs/verifiers_acereason-math.yaml,responses_api_models/vllm_model/configs/vllm_model.yaml]"
```

Collect rollouts
```
ng_collect_rollouts \
    +agent_name=verifiers_agent \
    +input_jsonl_fpath=responses_api_agents/verifiers_agent/data/acereason-math-example.jsonl \
    +output_jsonl_fpath=responses_api_agents/verifiers_agent/data/acereason-math-example-rollouts.jsonl \
    +limit=5
```

View a rollout in the terminal
```
tail -n 1 responses_api_agents/verifiers_agent/data/acereason-math-example-rollouts.jsonl | jq | less
```


## Testing new prime environments from environments hub

Testing new prime environments currently requires a few steps. 

Note that for Nemo RL training, multi-step environments currently require disabling replace prefix tokens and on policy assertion (todo: link).   

Some of the environments we found to work well as exampples include: `primeintellect/acereason-math`, `primeintellect/ascii-tree` and `primeintellect/alphabet-sort`.

### Creating a new dataset

We provide a helper script to make a verifiers dataset in `scripts/create_datset.py`. To run this for an environment, we first need to install the environment package: 

Install verifiers, prime, and an env:
```
uv add verifiers
uv add tool prime 
prime env install primeintellect/ascii-tree
```

Now create dataset. You can create train and validation datsets this way, but for now we just do example rollouts: 
```
python3 scripts/create_dataset.py --env-id primeintellect/ascii-tree --size 5 --output data/ascii-tree-example.jsonl
```

### Update agent server requirements

For each prime env, we currently need to update agent requirements manually. For multi environment, we can include more than 1 in a server requirements, however there may be package conflicts. 

Update `requirements.txt` to: 
```
-e nemo-gym[dev] @ ../../
verifiers>=0.1.9
--extra-index-url https://hub.primeintellect.ai/primeintellect/simple/
ascii-tree
```
### Update agent config
Create `configs/ascii-tree.yaml`, primarily updating env id, and any other env specific args: 
<!-- we could probably do this automatically with one config, but for now -->
```
verifiers_agent:
  responses_api_agents:
    verifiers_agent:
      entrypoint: app.py
      model_server:
        type: responses_api_models
        name: policy_model
      model_name: ""
      vf_env_id: ascii-tree
      vf_env_args: {}
      group_size: 1
      max_concurrent_generation: -1
      max_concurrent_scoring: -1
      max_tokens: 8192
      temperature: 1.0
      top_p: 1.0

```

Now launch NeMo Gym servers:
```
uv sync
ng_run "+config_paths=[responses_api_agents/verifiers_agent/configs/ascii-tree.yaml,responses_api_models/vllm_model/configs/vllm_model.yaml]"
```

Collect rollouts
```
ng_collect_rollouts \
    +agent_name=verifiers_agent \
    +input_jsonl_fpath=responses_api_agents/verifiers_agent/data/ascii-tree-example.jsonl \
    +output_jsonl_fpath=responses_api_agents/verifiers_agent/data/ascii-tree-example-rollouts.jsonl \
    +limit=5
```

Note we only change the env_id for each config so far, but environments can accept custom args, so we are providing separate configs in case we need these.

## Training 

Training with prime environments works like any other environment. However, using multiple prime environments may work best with separate agent servers for each environment for dependency isolation.
