# Environment Tutorials

Build custom training environments that define how models receive rewards.

---

## Environment Properties

Training environments can be broadly characterized along four dimensions:
1. **Rollout structure**: The interaction pattern between the model, environment, and user.
2. **Core capabilities**: The behaviors or skills that a model needs in order to succeed in a given use case.
3. **Knowledge domain**: What subject area, area of expertise, or field of study is involved.
4. **Task type**: The high-level use case that is represented in the training environment.

| Rollout structure | Description |
|---|---|
| Multi-step | Interleaved assistant and tool messages |
| Multi-turn | Interleaved user and assistant messages |
| Multi-modal | Interleaved text, image, video, and/or audio messages |
| Long context | Message content is very large or the number of messages is very large |

| Core capability | Developer/User need | Rollout Structures Required |
|---|---|---|
| Information dependency | The model receives environment responses that may require changes to subsequent actions. | Multi-step |
| Proactive asking |
| Information dependency | The model receives environment responses that may require changes to subsequent actions. | Multi step |
| Proactive asking | Developers put the model in a situation where user context is missing. The model needs to recognize user context is missing and ask the user for the missing context. | Multi turn |
| Schema adherence | Users need more than one piece of information delivered by the model at one time in a specified delivery format. | |
| Meta data instruction following | User constrains the meta-properties of the model response e.g. “respond in 5 words”. | |
|Counterintuitive instruction following	| User provides instructions that are against conventional wisdom, typically making sense in the specific context in which the model is being used | |
| Information relevance | Given a large volume of inputs, the model needs to ignore content irrelevant to the task at hand. | Long context |
| Multiple intent synthesis | Users provide multiple tasks for the model to accomplish. | Multi step, Multi turn |

## Verification Methods

| Method | When to Use | Example Server |
|---|---|---|
| **Exact match** | Answers have one correct form | `mcqa/app.py` — Choice grading |
| **Library verification** | Domain-specific parsing needed | `math_with_judge/app.py` — Uses `math_verify` library |
| **LLM-as-judge** | Semantic equivalence matters | `equivalence_llm_judge/app.py` — Configurable judge prompts |
| **Reward model** | Learned preferences | NeMo RL `RewardModelEnvironment` |

    A[1. Setup] --> B[2. Training Environment]
    B --> C[3. Train]
```

1. {doc}`/get-started/detailed-setup` — Install NeMo Gym
2. {doc}`creating-training-environment` — Build a training environment with verification
3. Start training with one of the {doc}`/training-tutorials/index`

## Reference Implementations

NeMo Gym includes working examples in `resources_servers/`:

| Server | Pattern | Verification |
|---|---|---|
| `mcqa/` | Single-step | Regex extraction, exact match |
| `example_multi_step/` | Multi-step | Function call validation |
| `calendar/` | Multi-turn | State comparison |
| `equivalence_llm_judge/` | Single-step | LLM judge with swap check |
| `math_with_judge/` | Single-step | Library + judge fallback |
| `aviary/` | Multi-step | Aviary environment integration |
| `workplace_assistant/` | Multi-step | Session state, tool routing |

:::{tip}
Use `ng_init_resources_server +entrypoint=resources_servers/my_env` to scaffold a new environment from a template.
