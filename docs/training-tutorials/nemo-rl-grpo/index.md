# RL Training with NeMo RL using GRPO

This tutorial trains NVIDIA [Nemotron Nano 9B v2](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2) to improve its **{term}`multi-step <Multi-step>` {term}`tool-calling <Tool Use / Function Calling>`** capability using the **{term}`GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) <GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization)>`** algorithm on the **Workplace Assistant** environment.

Workplace Assistant is a realistic office simulation (calendar, email, project management, etc.) with complex multi-step tasks, providing a strong data distribution for training enterprise-ready tool-using assistants.

:::{card}

**Goal**: Train a model for multi-step tool calling using GRPO on the Workplace Assistant environment.

**Time**: ~3-5 hours (full series)

^^^

**In this tutorial, you will**:

1. Set up NeMo RL and NeMo Gym for {term}`reinforcement learning <RL (Reinforcement Learning)>` training
2. Understand the Workplace Assistant environment and its multi-step tool calling tasks
3. Configure and run GRPO training on Nemotron Nano v2 9B
4. Monitor training progress via Weights & Biases (W&B)

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have these prerequisites ready:

- ✅ **Hardware**: 1+ nodes with 8× NVIDIA GPUs (80GB+ each, such as H100 or A100)
  - Single-node testing: 1 node with 8 GPUs
  - Multi-node production: 8+ nodes with 8 GPUs each recommended
  - RAM: 64 GB+ per node
- ✅ **Storage**: 100 GB+ free disk space on a shared filesystem
- ✅ **Software**: Linux, Python 3.12+, Git, Slurm for multi-node training
- ✅ **Familiarity**: Python, LLM fine-tuning, basic RL concepts (in-depth RLVR/GRPO knowledge not required)

:::{note}
NeMo Gym does not require GPUs. GPUs are only necessary for GRPO training with NeMo RL.
:::

**Optional accounts**:

- **Weights & Biases (W&B)**: For experiment tracking ([sign up](https://wandb.ai/signup), [get API key](https://wandb.ai/authorize)). Training proceeds without W&B if not configured.
- **HuggingFace**: For downloading models ([create token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)). Recommended to avoid rate limits.

**Total time estimate**: ~3-5 hours (including environment setup, data preparation, and training)
